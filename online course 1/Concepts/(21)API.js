//                                     API

// [1] API stands for application program interface.
// [2] Fatch API provide an interface  for sending and receiving resourses
// [3] APIs provide the data of the particular subject API related to
// [4] APIs used Request and Respone objects


// [5] Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming
 //languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They a
 //bstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.
//



// [6] Browser APIs are built into your web browser and are able to expose data from the browser
 //and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it. For example, 
 //the Web Audio API provides JavaScript constructs for manipulating audio in the browser â€” taking 
 //an audio track, altering its volume, applying effects to it, etc. In the background, the
 // browser is actually using some complex lower-level code (e.g. C++ or Rust) to do the 
 //actual audio processing. But again, this complexity is abstracted away from you by the API.
// [7] Third-party APIs are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to retrieve 
 //their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example, the Google Maps API allows 
 //you to do things like display an interactive map to your office on your website. It provides a
 //special set of constructs you can use to query the Google Maps service and return specific information.
